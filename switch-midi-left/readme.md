# Switch Midi M4L device

You will need [Max For Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/live/max-for-live/) for this to work.

This is the device you can download and drag into Ableton.

1. Pair you JoyCons first to your laptop/desktop bluetooth.

2. Then open Ableton and drag the .amxd into a midi track. 



You can purchase the entire Ableton set I built [here](https://gum.co/SRoCs) in case you don't want to figure out how to get this running.
